Part One
The page ordering rules and the pages to produce in each update are provided
I need to find out if an update has the pages in the right order
An update is on the format: X,Y,Z,C,V...
A page ordering rule is on the format A|B, meaning A must appear before B
  This only yields if both numbers are present
When we have found all updates in the right order, we need the middle page number
Then we will sum all these to get the answer
