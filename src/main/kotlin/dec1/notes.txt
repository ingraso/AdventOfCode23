Part 1
We have a list of historically significant locations.
The list contains location IDs.
There are two groups searching the office, creating lists of location IDs.
Pair up the numbers in the two lists, to figure out how far apart they are.
Pair up the smallest number in list 1 with the smallest in list 2, and so on.
Figure out the distance between the two numbers, and sum them up.
The total distance (summed) is the answer.

Part 2
Find out how often a number from the left list appears in the right.
Calculate a total similarity score.
    Multiply each number in L by the times it appears in the R list.
    Sum up all these numbers to get the answer.
