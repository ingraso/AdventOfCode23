Part One
The data consists of many reports, one per line
Each report is a list of numbers called levels, seperated by spaces
We want to figure out which reports are safe
To be safe, the levels must either increase or decrease in a report
Additionally, any two adjacent levels must differ by at least 1 and max 3
The answer is the amount of safe reports in the input

Part Two
The Problem Dampener tolerates a single bad level
Meaning if only one level is disqualifying the report, it can be distinguished
